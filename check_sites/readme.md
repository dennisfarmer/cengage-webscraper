# check_sites.py

This is a script to use for development purposes to check if the correct files are going to be retrieved from the website you are scraping. As you can see, it is just `scraper.py` with the actual scraping part cut out. Working with the `.html` files you plan to scrape from locally is a good way to simplify the process of adapting this script to your own use case.
